    <p>The active status of a household is useful when searching for or entering a new
        head of household.  An inactive household is less likely to be a duplicate
        of a new household. One may still access all of the data, though, of inactive households.
        It just takes an extra step or two.</p>
    <p>
        The column to the right shows the active status and number of households
        by the year of last contact.  To change the status of all households in 
        a give year from Active to Inactive simply click on the radio button to the
        right of the Active column.</p>
    <p>Please be aware that changing status for many records can take a minute or more.</p>
